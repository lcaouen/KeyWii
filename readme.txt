Software to use the wiimote in Windows games.
It converts the wiimote into a virtual keyboard so it can be used in any game.
It uses the wiimotelib (http://wiimotelib.codeplex.com)

Wiimotes must be paired to the computer (with bluesoleil or windows bluetooth) before running the application.

Possibility to have a virtual joystick thanks to ppjoy (http://ppjoy.blogspot.fr).
However ppjoy doesn't work on 64bits systems because of the license.
